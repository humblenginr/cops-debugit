## Why this project?
As the students of a premier institute, we all have a lot of things to manage. But we only have a limited amount of **time** with which we are striving to bring the best out of us! Ofc we can't do anthing with time as it keeps on ticking :stopwatch:, but we can take care of the energy that we spend on our day to day activities and try to refine them :sunglasses:. I thought, if i can create a platform where we can manage all our activities at one place, we would efffectively save a lot of time switching from one platform to other :bulb:. This project is just an effort in that direction :rainbow:.

## What are it's objectives?
I brainstormed for almost a day :sweat_smile: and came up with some functionalities that this product should offer. These ideas have come up keeping students of *IIT BHU* as the potential target.

## Short Demo
This [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qN5knG3NhjhoYPUPzI5_aoDfZ119TUlc/view?usp=sharing) shows how the calendar works for now!

## The Journey
I was very determined that i should finish this whole project. But guess what,i am writing this one day before the deadline and i have just completed the calendar functionality :rofl: </br>I now realize that this project needs a lot of attention because each and every minute thing has to taken care of :sweat_smile: </br> As i was doing the project, i would find that i would've missed some small details which i've not taken into account but plays an important role and i would spend time doing that :sweat:. And also, never to miss, there are bugs :bug: :bug: :bug: that you have to fix :sweat_smile:.</br> 


## Note of thanks
